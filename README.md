# BarMath Bare Bones
- Bare bones prototype for future flutter project
- app to help with loading a barbell in kilo plates for powerlifting
- Works on command line
- Written in java since it is similar to dart (used in flutter)

# Data Structure Used
- Custom stack data structure to represent the barbell
- Nodes to represent the individual plates
- custum stack data structure was a bit extraneous but I wanted to practice implementing one
